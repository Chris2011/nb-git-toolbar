<h1 style="color: #FF0000">This project is DEAD and NOT SUPPORTED by its former developer anymore.</h1>
Please fork it and create a new plugin from it. I can guide you through the process (as time allows), but I won't write code, accept pull-requests nor put updates to the NetBeans plugins center.
